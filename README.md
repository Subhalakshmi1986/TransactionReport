# TransactionReport
System which reports transaction results of the input csv file



## Design
--------

3 Files added 

1. TransactionReport  - Main class file which runs the report
2. TransactionRecord - Model for each individual records in csv
3. InputRecord - Model representing input from user


## Formula calculation
---------------------

Relative balance = sum of amount credited and sum of amount debited for the account during the period

Number of transactions = All "PAYMENT" transactions during the period

"REVERSAL" transactions and the related transactions excluded for reporting


## Additional Assumptions considered
------------------------------------

1. User will always give input in valid format 

## Prerequistes
---------------

1. Git installed

2. Gradle 5.4.1 installed

3. Java 1.8.0_211 installed


## Instructions to run the program:
----------------------------------
```
1. git clone https://github.com/Subhalakshmi1986/TransactionReport.git

2. Navigate to TransactionReport folder

3. gradle build

4. gradle run --console=plain

5. Console prompts for user input as below :


Enter the csv file path:/Users/SAISACHIEN/Desktop/Transactionrecords.csv

Enter the accountid(ACC######):ACC334455

Enter the start date("dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss"):20/10/2018 12:45:55

Enter the end date:("dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss"):20/10/2018 12:54:35
```

## Output

```
Relative Balance for the period is: -25.0

Number of transactions included is: 1
```





Requirements:

1 Introduction

The goal of the code challenge is to allow us to evaluate your software
development skills.
Please deliver a solution that meets requirements stated below.
We are looking for pragmatic, maintainable, easy to read code, as well
as tests that proves that your code works.
Feel free to use 3rd party libraries as you see fit to support the design
of your solution. Having said that, using frameworks like Spring,
Hibernate or an in-memory database is an overkill here.

1.1 Time & Effort

The code challenge is not time boxed. However, it is designed to take
about a couple of hours for the right candidate to complete. If you find
yourself spending significantly more than that then you probably got
something wrong.

2 The Problem
The goal of the challenge is to implement a system that analyses
financial transaction records.
A transaction record describes transferring money from one account to
another account. As such, each transaction record will have the
following fields:
• transactionId – The id of the transaction
• fromAccountId – The id of the account to transfer money from
• toAccountId – The id of the account to transfer money to
• createAt – the date and time the transaction was created (in the
format of
“DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss”)
• amount – The amount that was transferred including dollars and
cents
• transactionType – The type of the transaction which could be
either PAYMENT or REVERSAL.
• relatedTransaction – In case of a REVERSAL transaction, this
will contain the id of the transaction it is reversing. In case of a
PAYMENT transaction this field would be empty.
The system will be initialised with an input file in CSV format containing
a list of transaction records.
Once initialised it should be able to print the relative account balance
(positive or negative) in a given time frame.
The relative account balance is the sum of funds that were transferred
to / from an account in a given time frame, it does not account for funds
that were in that account prior to the timeframe.
Another requirement is that, if a transaction has a reversing transaction,
this transaction should be omitted from the calculation, even if the
reversing transaction is outside the given time frame.

2.1 Example Data

ME Bank D&I - API Team Coding Challenge
The following data is an example of an input CSV file transactionId,
fromAccountId, toAccountId, createdAt, amount, transactionType,
relatedTransaction
TX10001, ACC334455, ACC778899, 20/10/2018 12:47:55, 25.00, PAYMENT
TX10002, ACC334455, ACC998877, 20/10/2018 17:33:43, 10.50, PAYMENT
TX10003, ACC998877, ACC778899, 20/10/2018 18:00:00, 5.00, PAYMENT
TX10004, ACC334455, ACC998877, 20/10/2018 19:45:00, 10.50, REVERSAL,
TX10002 TX10005, ACC334455, ACC778899, 21/10/2018 09:30:00, 7.25,
PAYMENT

2.1 Example Input and Output
Given the above input CSV file, entering the following input arguments:
accountId:
ACC334455 from:
20/10/2018 12:00:00
to: 20/10/2018
19:00:00

The output should be:
Relative balance for the period is: -$25.00
Number of transactions included is: 1

2.2 Assumptions
For the sake of simplicity, it is safe to assume that
• Input file and records are all in a valid format
• Transaction are recorded in order

2.3 Deliverables
Please implement your solution using Java (version 8 or higher) or Kotlin.

ME Bank D&I - API Team Coding Challenge
Make sure you include tests that demonstrate that your solution is working.
Don’t forget to add a README file describing your design and how to build
/ run it.
Please submit your solution by sending us a link to a git repository
containing the source code.

Thank you.
